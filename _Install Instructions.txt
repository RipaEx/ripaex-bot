npm i discord.js
npm i request
npm i request-promise

In the botsettings.json set the channel to whatever you want. 

Create a bot on the developers portal and add your token which you get to the botsettings.json file:

https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

Note: By default it is named ripaex-bot but that can be changed if needed.

Run the following command in the bots dir:

node "bot.js"

The bot should now be running. Type !help in the Discord channel you set to see a list of the available commands.
